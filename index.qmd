I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://sds.wustl.edu) at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by Dr. [Debashis Mondal](https://sites.wustl.edu/debashismondal/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my A.B. degree with a major in Mathematics, a second major in Finance, and a minor in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis in 2021. My undergraduate thesis was advised by Dr. [José E. Figueroa-López](https://sites.wustl.edu/figueroa/).

My research interests include statistical modeling, computational methods, spatial statistics, time series, change points, as well as their applications in neuroimaging and brain dynamics.
