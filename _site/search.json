Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my A.B. degree with a major in Mathematics, a second major in Finance, and a minor in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis in 2021. My undergraduate thesis was advised by Professor José E. Figueroa-López.\nMy research interests include spatial statistics, high-dimensional data, time series, change points, as well as their applications in neuroimaging and brain dynamics.\n\ncontact: h dot zou at wustl dot edu"
